## *Hey hi howdy!* âœ¨

Please see [my website](https://yunru.se) if you want more info about me because I get so busy writing commit messages I forget I have a whole GitHub profile too.

My main projects are 

- **Noether**, which I am presently (Feb 2023) working on at least a few hours per weekend,
- **pxdlib**, which I usually work on an ad-hoc as-needed basis

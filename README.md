# Hey hi howdy!

I'm an MPhys Computational Physics undergrad, developer and novice author. My strengths are front-end code, design, data analysis and data structures. I've a good bit of experience in the public sector of the UK, but I'm very much interested in personal projects too, when time lets me! But it's a little occupied by study and my summer internship at a data security company :)

I post things sporadically to my [blog](https://yunru.se) and to [gists](https://gist.github.com/yunruse), too. Check them out!

# Hey hi howdy!

I'm a physics undergrad, developer and novice author. I've made front-end code for local governments and critical UK security companies, and I have a lot of cute projects under my belt.

I'm currently a student at the University of Edinburgh, and a summer intern at a data security company, so my projects might be a bit slow to update. And if they're not, tell me to get back to studying! :)

Most of the time I post new projects (or [gists](https://gist.github.com/yunruse) on my [blog](https://yunru.se); there you might find other tidbits of things I've made. Check it out!
